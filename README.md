Location Flow
Introduction
Location Flow is a React-based web application that allows users to interactively select their location on a map. This app utilizes React and Leaflet.js to display an interactive map where users can:

Enable their location using the browser's geolocation API.
Manually select a location by clicking on the map.
Save the selected location with the option to categorize it (e.g., Home, Office, Friends & Family).
See a popup on the marker with an option to enable the location.
The app's goal is to demonstrate how to build a basic location-based app using React and integrate with map libraries like Leaflet.

Features
Interactive map to display a location.
Ability to add custom locations by clicking on the map.
Popup on marker that enables location services.
Forms to manage saved locations and display them.
Tech Stack
React for building the user interface.
Leaflet.js for displaying interactive maps.
React-Leaflet for integrating Leaflet with React.
HTML5 Geolocation API for enabling user location on the map.
How to Execute the Project
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime to run the React application.
npm: The Node Package Manager to manage dependencies.
You can check if you have Node.js and npm installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
Steps to Set Up
Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-location-flow.git
Navigate to Project Folder

Change to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd location-flow
Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will launch the app in your default browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
When the app loads, you will see an interactive map.
Enable Location: Click the "Enable Location" button on the popup to use your current location (requires permission).
